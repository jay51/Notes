chapter6: Network Layer

*IP addrs and Router
*Router will route to spearte networks 
*switchies forward trafic inside network.

Network Layer:
-Assigning Ip addrs
-Encapsulation 
-Routeing to other networks

Network Layer protocol:
-IP4
-IP6


*IP is connectionless protocol and considered ureliable, means doesn't have the capablite to reacover...
*IP operates independently from the media that  carries the data at lower layers.
*The osi data link layer  takes care of sending the data.
*when ssh into a network, you get the ISP IP and ISP will route you inside the network.
*To publish a server you will need a static IP ,(all local networks have dynamic IP)(ISP have static IP )

Loopback: sending back packets to yourself 127.0....

*3 things you need to configer network IP, Subnet, Getway

*when sending request, switchies will first look inside local network in routing table for IP address. If switchie and Router can't find it, it will forward it to next switch/Router or Getway

COMMANDS:
-netStat -r (show routing table)
-Router
  -show ip route (show all interfaces on that router)
  -show version (os info)

*on a Cisco ISO Router, use "show ip route" to display the router's IPv4 routing table.

Memory types of router:
-RAM
-ROM
-ANVRAM (load Configs)
-FLASH (load OS)

*Console and oax are the port to access console on router

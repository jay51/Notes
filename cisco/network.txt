HTTP: An applecation protocol that governs the way a web server and a web client communecate

TCP: transport protocol that manges the indivdual conversations

IP: encapsulates the TCP segments into packets, assigns addresses.

Protocol suite: a set of protocols that work together to provide network communications

TCP/IP: protocol suite is an open standard, the protocols are freely available and any vendor is able to implement these protocols on their hardware or in their software.

Encapsulations Procedure:
1. the webserver prepares the hypertext(html)
the http application layer sends the data to the transport layer.
2.the transport layer breaks the data intp segments and identifies each.
3.next the IP source and destination addresses are added, creating an IP packet
4. the Ethernat is then added to create the frame
5. when receiving the data link frames from the web server, the client will removes each protocol header in the oppeste order.

Chapter:6
Configure Networking


Note: To setup networking on a server, your server needs 
a unique address on the netowrk. 


IP addresses are the addresses that allow nodes to communicate to any other
 node on the Internet. They are not the only addresses in use though. 
Each network card also has an address, which is known as the MAC address.
MAC addresses are for use on the local network (that is, 
the local cable or local WLAN, just up to the first router that is encountered)
; they cannot be used for communications between nodes that are on 
different networks. They are important, though,because MAC addresses help
computers find the specific network card that an IP address belongs to.

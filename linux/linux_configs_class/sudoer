Environment Configutation Files:
 when a user logs in, an environment is created for that user automatically. 
 This happens based on four different files where some scripts code can be
 specified and varibales can be defined for use by user.
 -/etc/profile: This is the generic file that is processed by all users upon login.
 -/etc/bashrc: This file is processed when subshells are started.
 -~/.bash_profile: In this file, user-specific login shell variables can be defined.
 -~/.bashrc: In this user-specific file, subshell variabless can be defined.


Note: Bash offers an option to include messages in the /etc/motd and the /etc/issue files.
Messages in /etc/motd display after a user has successfully logged in to a shell. And files in
/etc/issue display before user logs in.




Note: dmesg will tell you everything about the sys (everything)

Note:sd for drives sd1 and sd2 for partitions
Note: mkfs is a command to make file sys
Note: mount will mount your external device to usually to /mnt example (mount /dev/sda1 /mnt)

what is a buffer?
http://www.linfo.org/buffer.html
A buffer, also called buffer memory, is a portion of a computer's memory that is set aside as a temporary holding place for data 
that is being sent to or received from an external device, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), keyboard or printer. 
A buffer in a computer system is usually located between two devices that 
have different speeds for handling data or used when there is a difference in the timing of events.

Most text editors store the file being written or edited in a buffer.
The text is transferred to the HDD when it is saved, i.e., data from the buffer is copied over the original file on the HDD, 
thereby replacing it. Because changes are initially stored in a buffer, 
all of them will be lost if the computer crashes during an editing session. 
Thus, it is a good idea to frequently save files that are being worked on. 

When a command is issued to print a document, 
the operating system copies the document to a printer buffer from which the printer can use it at its own pace.
This frees the computer to perform other tasks while the printer is running in the background.

Note: most of the time we don't interact with the physical device but
we read or write to a buffer and when buffer is full or when we're done writing, data gets written to the device. 
A device is represented as a file by the operating system that we can read and write to such as the keyboard or display.

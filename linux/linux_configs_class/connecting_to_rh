Note: Every terminal used in a linux environment has a device file associated with it. 
Terminals that are started in a non-graphical environment are typically referred to through the devices /dev/tty1 - /dev/tty6

Note: For terminal windows that are started from a graphical env, pseudo terminals are started.
These pseudo terminals are referred to using numbers in /dev/pts for example /dev/pts/1 & /dev/pts/2.

Note: When logged into a terminal type "w" to show logged in users. "/var/log/auth.log" will also have all info about logged users.

Note: in case of emergency only use "echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger" to reset the machine.

Note To access a server using ssh, that server needs to have the sshd service running on port 22 
and it should not be blocked by firewall. give ssh -v flag to show you helpful info when sshing.


Note: to start graphical app through ssh you need 2 things. 1 an X server running on the client pc. 
X server is the software that creates the screens. 2 The remote host must be allowed to display screens on the local computer
by adding -X to ssh command.

Note: "scp" secure copy runs over sshd service. so, if you have ssh enabled, you should be able to scp files to remote machine.


Making public and private keys for ssh:
1. Use ssh-keygen to generate keys 
2. When asked to enter a passphrase hit enter for skipping
3. When asked for location of keys hit enter to keep default
4. Use ssh-copy-id to copy public key over to remote server
5. Next time you login, use ssh <server>



Note: The screen command let you start multiple terminal sessions for what ever reason and 
keep them on for as long as you like even if you detach from session and shutdown your computer.
To install screen type "yum install screen".

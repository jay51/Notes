Chapter: 6

On a Linux system, a wide variety of processes are normally being used. 
These processes need access to specific resources on the Linux system. 
To determine how these resources can be accessed, a difference is made between 
processes that run in kernel mode and processes that run without full permissions to the operating system. 
In the latter case user accounts are needed.


On Linux, there are two ways to look at system security. There are privileged users, and there are unprivileged users. 
The default privileged user is root. This user account has full access to everything on a Linux server and 
is allowed to work in system space without restrictions. The root user account is meant to perform system administration tasks and 
should be used for that only. For all other tasks, an unprivi-leged user account should be used.

 Note: When you log in as root in a graphical environment, all tasks that are executed are running as root as well.


su: Opens a subshell as a different user, with the advantage that only in the subshell commands are executed as root.



PolicyKit: Allows you to set up graphical utilities to run with administrative privileges.

Note: when you login as another user with "su" environment settings for that user account have not been set. 
If you need complete access to the entire environment of the tar-get user account, you can use "su -" to start a login shell.

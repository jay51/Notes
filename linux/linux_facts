Note: settings files should be in "/etc" and executable files should be in "/bin" or "/sbin".
Note: Shared Data should be placed inside "/usr/share".
Note: You can create hidden files/dir by prepending the name of the file/dir with a ".".
Note: When a process is created, it inherite s most of the env settings of its parent process like
the SHELL and a shell program/command.

Note: env variables are temp vars in the current shell. Add your env vars to .bashrc or .profile to
make it permanent.

Note: To make an executable run from anywhere in your file sys, you need to add it to "bin" or
a hard link to the executable. You could also just add the dir of executable to path likeso 
"$path=$path:/pathto/executable"

Note: To copy files to external server use scp(secure copy)

Note: if you ever forget your password and can't login to the sys, you could boot into GRUB(is a boot loader, the first software 
that runs at a system boot and load the Kernel) and select single user mode (add init=/bin/bash/ to kernel line to tell the kernel to start a shell) 
then open a shell in single user-mode and mount the sys root dir '/'
becuase single mode put you in read only mode then you got root (mount -o remount,rw /) this remount the `/` for read and write.

Note: Normally linux boots up in multi-user mode which mean that more than one user can be logged in to your computer at the same time. 
In single-user mode only root user are allowed to log in. also referred to as maintenance mode and runlevel 1,
is a mode of operation of a computer running Linux or another Unix-like os that provides as few services as possible and only minimal functionality.

Note: There'are also other modes such as rescue mode and emergency mode.

Note: The `export` command is used to export environment variables to sub/child process
Note: The `source` command is used to run a script in the current shell.
By default when you mark a script as executable and run it, it runs in a sub shell.

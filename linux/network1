chapter5: Ethernet


Ethernet operates in the data-link layer and physical layer.

LLc : handles the communication between the upper layers and the lower layers.

MAC:
-Data encapsulation
-Media access control

*Frames less thean 64 bytes ....
*last 3 byts are uniqe to each MAC addr
*when a device is forwading a message to an Ethernet network, it attaches aheader info to the frame
*the header containe the source and destination MAC addr

Memory Buffering Method:
-posr-based memory
-shared memory

*There are 2 primary addresses assigned to a device on an Ethernet LAN
-Physical addrs MAC
-Logical addrs IP
*when the destination IP addrs is on a remote network, the destination MaC addrs will be the address of the host's default gateway.
*To determine the destination MAC addrs, the device uses ARP.

ARP:
Rus on a switch
Resolving IPv4 addrs to MAC addrs.
Maintainiing a table of mappings.
ARP request message includes => Target IPv4 addrs and MAC addrs
